# Overview

ONE REGION TO RULE THEM ALL!!!

...sorry, with that out of the way, let's get serious.

The Global Region is the region which is parent to **all** Dimensional Regions. Most things you are familiar with from Dimensional Regions work the same way with the Global Region.

They can have owners, members, flags, have a state, etc. Additionally, the CLI for the Global Region allows you to manage your Dimensional Regions as well.

## Creation

You don't. The Global Region is always there, by default active but not configured.

## Managing [Commands](../../commands/region/global-commands)

The Global Region, as the other regions, can be managed only by their owners, or by players which have the
required [permission](../../config/permissions).

Members will only bypass flags, like owners do. Note that even with the permission from the config, you won't be able to bypass flags when you are not a member or an owner of a region.

To manage the Global Region, just use the `/yawp global [info]` command. This will show you the interactive info of the Global Region.
