# Upcoming flag flattening/overhaul

**Note**
- Flags with an **asterix** (*) will be implemented as a new kind of flag which will allow setting granular deny and allow entries.
- Example1 (`break-blocks`): deny/allow specific blocks to be broken
- Example2 (`spawning`): deny/allow specific mob spawning
- Example3 (`exec-command`): deny/allow execution of specific commands
- This list is not final nor a promise for implementation. Flags still might be changed/removed/added.

| Flag                       | `<= 0.6.0` |                  `>= 0.6.0`                  |
